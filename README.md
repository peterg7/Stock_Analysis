# Stock Analysis

This project involved analyzing stock data from 2017 and 2018. Both data sets contained 12 stocks with various stats about how to stock performed at a certain time. 

## Challenge

In the workbook, there is a macro that takes in user input to determine which stock year to analyze. The macro then computes the total trading volume and return rate of each stock. The macro is very robust. More stocks can be added (in the same format as the others) or some removed without needing to change the macro. Data from a new year could also be added as an entirely new sheet and still no changes would be needed. The macro determines all the stocks in the sheet and extracts the necessary data. It is quite efficent, only looping through the data once and then performing simple formatting operations.
